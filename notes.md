JAN 21

Workflow:
* Develop as a python project - separate scripts, easier git, less conflicts, more maintainable. Copy/export to notebook for necessary testing (when possible, run/test directly in the .py script to reduce copy/pasting) or even just for the final delivery.
* Adhere to the template structure - whatever logic lives in the template stays there, and we import template.py as needed. It'll make final integration a copy/paste with minor adjustments for jupyter.
